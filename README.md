# Perspective-Transformer
This Python program uses OpenCV to perform a perspective transformation on an image. It allows the user to specify the coordinates of four points in the source image and maps them to a new image of specified dimensions.


# Usage

1. Run the script.
   
2. Follow the on-screen prompts to provide the necessary input:
  Image filename (e.g., image.jpg)
  New height and width of the desired image
  Coordinates of the four corners (top left, bottom left, top right, bottom right)

  Note: You need to know the coordinates of the four corners in the source image.

3. The program will process the image and save the transformed image as `Modified image.jpg` in the current directory.
   

# Example

Enter the filename for conversion along with the format, e.g., .jpg: example.jpg
Required height of the image: 500
Required width of the image: 700
Coordinates of the top left corner, separated by a comma: 50,50
Coordinates of the bottom left corner, separated by a comma: 50,450
Coordinates of the top right corner, separated by a comma: 650,50
Coordinates of the bottom right corner, separated by a comma: 650,450
DONE! You can close the program or press ENTER
